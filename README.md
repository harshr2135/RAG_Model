#Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model

##Overview

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to extract and retrieve relevant information from a document corpus. The model is designed as a document-based question-answering system, specializing in the basics:

*Data Structures
*Programming Paradigms
*Computer Networks

It uses cosine similarity-based retrieval to find the most relevant document based on user queries.

##Features

*PDF Document Extraction: Uses pdfquery to parse and extract data from PDFs.

*Cosine Similarity Matching: Implements a similarity function to identify the most relevant document.

*Topic-Specific Retrieval: Allows users to choose between different RAG models specialized in different domains.

*Interactive Query System: Users can enter queries and receive the most relevant document as a response.
