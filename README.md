# RAG_Model
This project implements a RAG model for question-answering on Data Structures, Programming Paradigms, and Computer Networks. It extracts data from PDFs using pdfquery and retrieves relevant documents via cosine similarity. Users select a topic, enter a query, and receive the best-matching document.
